# angular1workshop
This workshop serves as an introduction to the Angular framework. During this workshop there will be requests sent to 
the [fakeBacked](../master/libs/fake-backend.js).  The fake-backend should not be edited, but it's recommended to take a
look into it.

## Content
This branch contains the base code of the workshop. This base consists of our application module [myApp](../master/scripts/app.js) and one 
controller named [HomeCtrl](../master/scripts/controllers/home.controller.js).
